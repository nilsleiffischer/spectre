# We need to link custom allocators before we link anything else so that
# any third-party libraries, which generally should all be built as shared
# libraries, use the allocator that we use. Unfortunately, how exactly
# CMake decides on the linking order is not clear when using
# INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES and targets. To this end, we set a global
# property SPECTRE_ALLOCATOR_LIBRARY that contains the link flag to link
# to the memory allocator. By linking to the allocator library first
# explicitly in target_link_libraries CMake correctly places the allocator
# library as the first entry in the link libraries. We also link to the
# SpectreAllocator target to pull in any additional allocator-related
# flags, such as include directories.
#
# Targets can grab the link flags using:
#
#   get_property(
#     SPECTRE_ALLOCATOR_LIBRARY
#     GLOBAL
#     PROPERTY SPECTRE_ALLOCATOR_LIBRARY
#     )
#   target_link_libraries(${TARGET_NAME}
#     PUBLIC
#     ${SPECTRE_ALLOCATOR_LIBRARY}
#     SpectreAllocator
#     )
#
# These need to be the first call to target_link_libraries of the target.
