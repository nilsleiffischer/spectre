 * \brief The Poisson equation formulated as a set of coupled first-order PDEs.
 *
 * \details This system formulates the Poisson equation \f$-\Delta_\gamma u(x) =
 * f(x)\f$ on a background metric \f$\gamma_{ij}\f$ as the set of coupled
 * first-order PDEs
 *
 * \f[
 * -\partial_i \gamma^{ij} v_j(x) - \Gamma^i_{ij}\gamma^{jk}v_k = f(x) \\
 * -\partial_i u(x) + v_i(x) = 0
 * \f]
 *
 * where we have chosen the field gradient as an auxiliary variable \f$v_i\f$
 * and where \f$\Gamma^i_{jk}=\frac{1}{2}\gamma^{il}\left(\partial_j\gamma_{kl}
 * +\partial_k\gamma_{jl}-\partial_l\gamma_{jk}\right)\f$ are the Christoffel
 * symbols of the second kind of the background metric \f$\gamma_{ij}\f$.
 * This scheme also goes by the name of _mixed_ or _flux_ formulation (see e.g.
 * \cite Arnold2002). The reason for the latter name is that we can write the
 * set of coupled first-order PDEs in flux-form
 *
 * \f[
 * -\partial_i F^i_A + S_A = f_A(x)
 * \f]
 *
 * by choosing the fluxes and sources in terms of the system variables
 * \f$u(x)\f$ and \f$v_i(x)\f$ as
 *
 * \f{align*}
 * F^i_u &= \gamma^{ij} v_j(x) \\
 * S_u &= -\Gamma^i_{ij}\gamma^{jk}v_k \\
 * f_u &= f(x) \\
 * F^i_{v_j} &= u \delta^i_j \\
 * S_{v_j} &= v_j \\
 * f_{v_j} &= 0 \text{.}
 * \f}
 *
 * Note that we use the system variables to index the fluxes and sources, which
 * we also do in the code by using DataBox tags.
 * Also note that we have defined the _fixed sources_ \f$f_A\f$ as those source
 * terms that are independent of the system variables.
 *
 * The field gradient \f$v_i\f$ is treated on the same footing as the field
 * \f$u\f$ in this first-order formulation. This allows us to make use of the DG
 * architecture developed for coupled first-order hyperbolic PDEs in flux-form,
 * in particular the flux communication and lifting code. It does, however,
 * introduce auxiliary degrees of freedom that can be avoided in the
 * second-order (or _primal_) formulation. Furthermore, the linear operator that
 * represents the DG discretization for this system is not symmetric. This
 * property further increase the computational cost (see \ref LinearSolverGroup)
 * and is remedied in the second-order formulation.
