# Note that this library has two special source files: InfoAtCompile.cpp and
# InfoAtLink.cpp. These files contain placeholder strings that CMake fills in
# (in copies of the files in the build directory) when configuring the build.
#
# We track the *generated* InfoAtCompile.cpp as a library source. This means
# that CMake must have been configured *before* checking library dependencies
# via the CMake function check_spectre_libs_dependencies.
#
# We do *not* track InfoAtLink.cpp as a library source, as it is used only to
# inject information late in the build process. The InfoAtLink target defined
# below determines the approriate flags for compiling InfoAtLink.cpp.
