 * \brief Returns a `Matrix` by which to multiply the nodal coefficients to
 * apply a stable exponential filter.
 *
 * The exponential filter rescales the modal coefficients according to:
 *
 * \f{align*}{
 *  c_i\to c_i \exp\left[-\alpha \left(\frac{i}{N}\right)^{2m}\right]
 * \f}
 *
 * where \f$c_i\f$ are the zero-indexed modal coefficients, \f$N\f$ is the basis
 * degree (number of grid points per element per dimension minus one),
 * \f$\alpha\f$ determines how much the coefficients are rescaled, and \f$m\f$
 * determines how aggressive/broad the filter is (lower values means filtering
 * more coefficients). Setting \f$\alpha=36\f$ results in setting the highest
 * coefficient to machine precision, effectively zeroing it out.
 *
 * \note The filter matrix is not cached by the function because it depends on a
 * double, an integer, and the mesh, which could make caching very memory
 * intensive. The caller of this function is responsible for determining whether
 * or not the matrix should be cached.

 * \brief Zeros the lowest `number_of_modes_to_zero` modal coefficients. Note

 * Given a function \f$u\f$

 * \f{align}{

 * \f}
 *
 * where \f$c_i\f$ are the modal coefficients and \f$P_i(x)\f$ is the basis
 * (e.g. Legendre polynomials), the filter matrix will take the *nodal*
 * representation of \f$u\f$ and zero out the lowest `number_of_modes_to_zero`
 * modal coefficients. That is, after the filter is applied \f$u\to\bar{u}\f$ is
 *
 * \f{align}{
 *   \bar{u}(x)=\sum_{i=k}^N c_i P_i(x),
 * \f}
 *
 * where \f$k\f$ is the number of modes set to zero. The output \f$\bar{u}\f$ is
 * also in the *nodal* representation.
